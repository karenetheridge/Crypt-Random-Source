=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Moose;
    extends qw(Crypt::Random::Source::Base);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an abstract base class.

In the future it will be a role.

=method get $n, %args

Gets C<$n> random bytes and returns them as a string.

This method may produce fatal errors if the source was unable to provide enough
data.

=method read $buf, $n, [ $off ]

This method is cannibalized from L<IO::Scalar>. It provides an L<IO::Handle>
work-alike.

Note that subclasses override this to operate on a real handle directly if
available.

=method seed @stuff

On supporting sources this method will add C<@stuff>, whatever it may be, to
the random seed.

Some sources may not support this, so be careful.

=method available

This is a class method, such that when it returns true calling C<new> without
arguments on the class should provide a working source of random data.

This is use by L<Crypt::Random::Source::Factory>.

=method rank

This is a class method, with some futz value for a ranking, to help known good
sources be tried before known bad (slower, less available) sources.

=method get_data %Params

Provided for compatibility with L<Crypt::Random>
